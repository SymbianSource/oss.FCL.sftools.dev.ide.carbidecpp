<h2>Welcome to Carbide.c++ 2.0.4 </h2>
<p>Thank you for installing Carbide.c++2.0! It's an improvement over 1.3.1 with many improvements to connecting and debugging on devices, faster downloading of  large SIS files, improved program counter control, C/C++ indexer improvements, and is based on the latest Eclipse and CDT updates (Ganymede). </p>
<p>However, perhaps the best part about Carbide.c++ is the Carbide.c++ Plug-in SDK that you can use to build custom extensions for Carbide.c++. Take a look, and let us know what you built!</p>
<p>Finally, if you find bugs, please let us know by submitting it at the new Carbide Bugzilla bug tracking site located at <a href="https://xdabug001.ext.nokia.com/bugzilla">https://xdabug001.ext.nokia.com/bugzilla</a> </p>
<p>For any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p> Thank you again for choosing Carbide.c++! We hope you like it. </p>
